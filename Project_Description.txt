Project Overview:
The aim of this project is to predict the sales of different product categories (Coffee, DryFruit and Soup) with the help of sophisticated time series analysis particularly SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average). Evaluating the separate sales forecasting models for each product class the project results in a full and precise organization of demand that can be adopted by any business for planning and management of stock.
Key Features:
Multi-Product Forecasting: Separate models for Coffee, DryFruit, and Soup sales, allowing individual forecasts for each category.
Time Series Modeling: SARIMA models for capturing seasonality, trends, and autocorrelation in sales data.
Visualization: Forecasted results are plotted for easy comparison with actual sales trends.
Performance Evaluation: Forecasting accuracy is assessed using common metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and AIC (Akaike Information Criterion).
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, resampling, and ensuring consistent frequency for time series data.
Use Cases:
Demand Forecasting: Helps businesses plan for future demand and optimize inventory management.
Sales Strategy: Provides insights into seasonal trends, helping to shape marketing and sales strategies.
Performance Monitoring: Allows continuous monitoring of sales predictions against actual outcomes to improve decision-making.
